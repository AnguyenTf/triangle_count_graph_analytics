# Triangle Counting in CUDA & C++

![CUDA Graph Pipeline](assets/triangle_count.png)

## Overview

This repository is my deep dive into GPU-accelerated graph analytics, built entirely form scratch using CUDA and C++. I didn't want to just write a kernel, I wanted to understand the whoe pipeline: from loading in messy data, converting it into a clean CSR layout, and then pushing it through a GPU kernel that can handle millions of edges in parallel. 

Along the way, I used Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute to study how my code actually behaves on the GPU, not in theory, but in real hardware. This project became a hands-on way for me to learn how high-performance GPU systems are designed, debugged, and optimized.

### Why this project matters 

I've always been fascinated by how GPUs go through massive workloads, but I realized I didn't truly understand what happens between "write a kernel" and "get fast results." This project turned out to be the perfect challenge for me:

- It's simple to explain
- It forces me to think about memory layout
- It exposes how GPU's behave under irregular workloads
- It rewards careful engineering

Working through this project taught me how much performance comes from everything around the kernel: the data structures, the memory access patterns, the launch configuration, and the profiling tools that reveal what's really happening under the hood.

### Highlights

- Custom graph ingestion pipeline
- Clean CSR construction with sorted adjacency lists
- Memory coalesced structure of arrays layout for edges
- Safe CUDA error handing with CUDA_CHECK
- Per-edge parallelism for high GPU throughput
- Full performance analysis using Nsight Systems and Nsight Compute

### Architecture

1) Read an edge list file (ordered or unordered)
2) Normalize each edge so that u < v
3) Sort edges by (u, v) to guarantee deterministic adjacency lists
4) Build CSR (row_ptr + col_idx)
5) For each edge (u, v), run a two-pointer intersection on neighbors(u) and neighbors(v)
6) Count all w such that u < v < w
7) Parallelize the entire process on the GPU
